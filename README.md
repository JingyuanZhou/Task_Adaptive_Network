The code of generating dataset with mix degradation factors and training Task Adaptive Network .

We construct a mixed degradation factors dataset that combines three degradation factors of rain, haze, and raindrop. And to deal with this problem, We propose a task-adaptive attention module to enable the network to restore images with multiple degradation factors.
